Hi, I'm Jose Leon. I'm a software engineer and I've always been into HPC and parallel computing.
I'm currently learning my way through Swift and Apple's Metal API to perform parallel computing on the GPU.
I know how to program in C, C++, C#, Python and Java. Also, I spend a lot of time learning about software architecture.
